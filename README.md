## 📝 Description
<p align="justify"> 
  
The project was developed by students of the Front-end course, class 36, of the Senac/PE institution. The Cactus game works in a similar way to the original Wordle, 
but Cactus was developed with typical words from the Brazilian Northeast region. 
The user receives daily a word that must be deciphered by the players. <br>
The game has only hints indicated by the colors of the letters 
placed in each attempt. The word remains for 24 hours, the player has 7 chances, in which, in each of them, he can risk a 6-letter word.
At each attempt, the game will warn which letters are right and which are wrong, and the colors will be changed according to the hits and misses of the entry.
